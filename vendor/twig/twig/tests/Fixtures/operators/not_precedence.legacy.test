--TEST--
*, /, //, and % will have a higher precedence over not in Twig 4.0
--DEPRECATION--
Since twig/twig 3.15: Add explicit parentheses around the "not" unary operator to avoid behavior change in the next major version as its precedence will change in "index.twig" at line 2.
--TEMPLATE--
{{ not 1 * 2 }}
--DATA--
return []
